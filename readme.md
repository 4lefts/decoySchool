Code to build a static site for [Decoy Community Primary School](http://decoyschool.co.uk). Uses [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io).

To build:
* `git clone` this repo
* `npm install`
* `gulp`

This will build a folder called *build* which we can serve. 

N.B. the gulpfile also runs browser sync, with starts a development server at localhost:3000
