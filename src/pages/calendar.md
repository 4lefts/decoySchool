## Family Thrive Information Coming Soon - September 2016##

This September we will be running our fifth Family Thrive course where parents can learn about the amazing growth of their childâ€™s brain through childhood and help support their emotional development. The sessions will be on Wednesday afternoons (1:15pm - 3:15pm). Please see Mrs Stables for more information or register your interest with Donna in the office.
