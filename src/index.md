## THANK YOU

Decoy Primary School would like to say a huge **“THANK YOU” to ‘Amberon’** for allowing our school to borrow 200 traffic cones in order to create our one-way ‘drop-off’ and ‘pick-up’ system around school. Their kindness in helping us out has meant that our school community has been able to stay much safer during what are the busiest times of the school day.

**Amberon** were quick to get in touch with us and their communication and response to our request was more than impressive. Our contact, Ryan, was extremely helpful and we greatly appreciated his support with this.  
From behalf of all of the children, staff, parents, families, Governors and wider school community, we would like to say a **big thank you for helping to ‘Keep Us Safe!’**

## Welcome Message from Mrs Poustie

On behalf of the children, staff, and governors I should like to welcome you to Decoy Primary School.

Our school vision is underpinned by our four values which are: ‘Have a Go’, ‘Make the Right Choices’, ‘Do your Best’, ‘Think of Others’ and our golden rule which is: 'Treat other people as you would like them to treat you'. These values are embedded in the culture of the school which has a welcoming and vibrant atmosphere.

Whilst Maths and English are key areas of learning, we strive to provide a vibrant curriculum, which is enhanced by active learning. Every child is encouraged to engage in a variety of wider opportunities, including residential trips, sporting activities, performances and creative workshops. By encouraging the children to take part in new experiences the children have regular opportunities to meet with success.

Decoy is a Community Primary School and we work closely with families to support all children to achieve. Our active Parent Teacher Association support the school, organising fund raising and social events, keeping the school at the heart of the community.

I hope our website gives you a glimpse of what we do and enough information for you to want to find out more. If you have not already visited the school, we would be delighted to meet you. Please contact us either by telephone or email to arrange a visit.

Kind regards,  
Mrs Heather Poustie  
Headteacher
