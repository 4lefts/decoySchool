## OFSTED Report
For the full report please click [here][4]

Following the inspection on the 29th and 30th of November, I am pleased to present a copy of our OFSTED report. The school was graded as ‘Good’ overall, and our Early Years provision has been recognised as being ‘Outstanding’. The report shows the excellent progress made by the school since the previous inspection in 2014.

The inspection took place over two days and was carried out with half a day’s notice. The inspectors observed lessons, scrutinised pupils’ work and interviewed pupils, teachers and governors. They reviewed the school’s Self Evaluation Document, Development Plan, a wide range of data and the questionnaires completed by pupils, parents and staff. They also looked at our attendance, safeguarding and behaviour management records. This resulted in a thorough evaluation of all aspects of our school.

The report recognises the quality of teaching throughout the school and the way that pupils are supported to make progress. It highlights the excellent start they receive in Nursery and Reception.
I am particularly proud that the inspectors could so clearly see the strength of relationships and caring nature of our school community.

There are a few points for development – there always will be. We will discuss these with staff and governors and include them in our improvement plan as we continue to make the school even better!

I would like to take this opportunity to thank staff, governors, pupils and parents for their hard work and determination, leading to this positive outcome.

Here are some of the highlights of the report: <strong>

•	Leaders, staff and governors have created a culture where pupils’ well-being and educational success go hand in hand.

•	Relationships between pupils and teachers are excellent. Pupils have total belief in their teachers to support them and help them to achieve their best.

•	All pupils say they feel safe. They trust their teachers and know how to get immediate help if needed.

•	Teachers use their strong subject knowledge to promote high achievement in a wide range of subjects.

•	Pupils’ attainment is rising quickly and differences between groups of pupils are diminishing. Leaders, staff and governors are taking clear and determined steps to make sure that all pupils achieve equally well.

•	A strength of teaching across the school is precise questioning by teachers and teaching assistants, to extend pupils’ learning.

•	Teaching Assistants … are knowledgeable and skilled…

•	Staff have high expectations of pupils’ learning and behaviour. The vast majority of pupils rise to these expectations by working hard and behaving well.

•	Pupils also told inspectors how there is very little bullying and name calling from their peers, because ‘everyone cares for each other’. On the rare occasions when bullying does occur, they know that any member of staff will deal with the issues fairly and quickly as ‘this school does not tolerate bullying’. </strong>

Finally, here are some of the reasons why the inspectors graded our Early Years as Outstanding: <strong>

•	From their varying starting points, children make rapid progress in both Nursery and Reception classes.

•	Adults working in the early years are effective and knowledgeable because of the training and support they receive from their highly skilled leader.

•	The rich and varied curriculum engages children’s imaginations and curiosity. Children have fun when they are learning and make excellent progress as a result. </strong>

This is a wonderful way to start 2017 following a couple of challenging years. Thank you for your faith in us during this time – it is greatly appreciated. We look forward to continuing to work in partnership with you as we go from strength to strength.

Yours Sincerely

Mrs Gill O'Neill
